async def mcp_ticktick_ticktick_get_by_id(obj_id: str) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves a single TickTick object (task, project, tag, etc.) using its unique ID.

    Args:
        obj_id (str): The unique ID string of the object to retrieve. Required.
                     Can be a task ID, project ID, tag ID, or any other valid TickTick object ID.

    Returns:
        A JSON string with one of the following structures:
        - Success: The complete object with all its properties
        - Not Found: null or empty response if the object doesn't exist
        - Error: {"error": "Error message describing what went wrong", "result": null, "status": "error"}

    Limitations:
        - Can only retrieve objects the user has access to
        - Different object types (tasks, projects, tags) have different property structures
        - Does not provide information about related objects (e.g., a project's tasks)
        - The ID must be valid and refer to an existing object
        - Some fields may not be populated depending on the object type and user permissions

    Examples:
        Get a task by ID:
        {
            "obj_id": "task_abcdef12345"
        }

        Get a project by ID:
        {
            "obj_id": "project_ghijk67890"
        }

        Get a tag by ID:
        {
            "obj_id": "tag_lmnop54321"
        }

    Agent Usage Guide:
        - Use this tool when you need specific details about a known object with its ID
        - Helpful for getting full details before updating an object
        - For tasks, this retrieves a single task including any subtasks
        - For projects, this retrieves the project details (name, color) but not its tasks
        - IDs are typically retrieved from other API calls like ticktick_get_all or ticktick_filter_tasks
        - Example mapping:
          "Get details of my quarterly report task" â†’
          First find the task ID using ticktick_filter_tasks
          Then: {"obj_id": "[found task ID]"}
        - If the object is not found (null response), explain to the user it might not exist or they might not have access
        - Very useful in workflows that require multiple steps, like update or delete operations

    """
    Retrieves a list of all TickTick objects of a specified type.

    Args:
        search (str): The type of objects to retrieve. Required.
               Must be one of: 'tasks', 'projects', 'tags', 'project_folders'.
               Case insensitive (e.g., 'Projects' is the same as 'projects').

    Returns:
        A JSON string with one of the following structures:
        - Success: A list of objects of the requested type (may be empty)
        - Error: {"error": "Error message describing what went wrong", "status": "error"}

    Limitations:
        - For 'tasks', only uncompleted tasks are returned by default
        - For large accounts, response size might be very large 
        - Different object types have different property structures
        - Some object types might not be available depending on the user's subscription level
        - The API might limit the number of results for performance reasons
        - For a large number of tasks, consider using ticktick_filter_tasks instead
        - Does not retrieve nested structures (e.g., tasks within projects)

    Examples:
        Get all projects:
        {
            "search": "projects"
        }

        Get all tags:
        {
            "search": "tags"
        }

        Get all uncompleted tasks:
        {
            "search": "tasks"
        }

        Get all project folders:
        {
            "search": "project_folders"
        }

    Agent Usage Guide:
        - Use this tool to get a comprehensive list of a specific object type
        - Particularly useful for:
          1. Discovering available projects to organize tasks
          2. Finding existing tags to categorize tasks
          3. Getting an overview of project folders for organization
        - For tasks, consider using ticktick_filter_tasks for more targeted results
        - When user asks for "all my projects" or "list of projects", use {"search": "projects"}
        - When user asks for "all my tags" or "available tags", use {"search": "tags"}
        - When user asks for "all my tasks", consider if they really need ALL tasks or just:
          - Tasks from a specific project
          - Tasks with certain due dates
          - Tasks with specific priorities
          In these cases, ticktick_filter_tasks would be more appropriate
        - When retrieving all tasks, warn the user if there are many results
